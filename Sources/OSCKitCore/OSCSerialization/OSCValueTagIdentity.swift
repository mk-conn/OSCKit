    /// content of the value.
    /// All possible type tags must be finite and known at compile time.

    /// One (perhaps the only) example of a variadic implementation is an OSC value array. It starts
    /// with the `[` tag and ends with the `]` tag and may contain zero or more value tags. Its
    /// definition would have a `minCount` of `2` and a `maxCount` of `nil`. Variadic is how OSCKit
    /// itself internally implements OSC array encoding and decoding.
