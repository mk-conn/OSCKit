/// OSC Address Pattern
///
/// An OSC address pattern is a path string that may contain certain wildcards and pattern matching
/// sequences.
///
/// > [OSC 1.0 Spec](http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_0.html):
/// >
/// > - OSC server dispatches to all OSC Method subscribers that match the address pattern.
/// > - Address path components are known as Containers, and the final path component is the Method
/// >   name.
/// > - Address patterns may or may not contain any wildcards. If no wildcards are contained, then the
/// >   address matches if it matches verbatim.
/// > - All the matching OSC Methods are invoked with the same argument data, namely, the OSC
/// >   Arguments in the OSC Message.
/// > - An OSC Address Pattern matches an OSC Address if:
/// >   1. The OSC Address and the OSC Address Pattern contain the same number of parts; and
/// >   2. Each part of the OSC Address Pattern matches the corresponding part of the OSC Address.
/// >
/// > These are the matching rules for characters in the OSC Address Pattern:
/// > - `?` in the OSC Address Pattern matches any single character
/// > - `*` in the OSC Address Pattern matches any sequence of zero or more characters
/// > - `[chars]` - a string of characters in square brackets in the OSC Address Pattern matches any
/// >   character in the string. Inside square brackets, the minus sign (`-`) and exclamation point
/// >   (`!`) have special meanings:
/// >   - Two characters separated by a minus sign indicate the range of characters between the given
/// >     two in ASCII collating sequence. (A minus sign at the end of the string has no special
/// >     meaning.)
/// >   - An exclamation point at the beginning of a bracketed string negates the sense of the list,
/// >     meaning that the list matches any character not in the list. (An exclamation point anywhere
/// >     besides the first character after the open bracket has no special meaning.)
/// > - `{foo,bar}` - A comma-separated list of strings enclosed in curly braces in the OSC Address
/// >   Pattern matches any of the strings in the list.
/// > - Any other character in an OSC Address Pattern can match only the same character.
///
/// > [OSC 1.1 Spec](http://opensoundcontrol.org/spec-1_1.html):
/// >
/// > The 1.1 spec was never formalized, but the white-paper is available.
/// >
/// > - Inherits OSC 1.0 pattern matching and adds the `//` operator
///
