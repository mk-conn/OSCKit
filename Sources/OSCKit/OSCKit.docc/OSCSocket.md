# ``OSCKit/OSCSocket``

### Setup

If not specified during initialization, the local port will be randomly assigned by the system. The same port will be used to both listen for incoming events and send outgoing events from. This port may only be configured at the time of initialization.

The remote port may be omitted, in which case the same port number as the local port will be used. The remote port may be overridden if supplied as a parameter when calling ``OSCSocket/send(_:to:port:)``.

```swift
let oscSocket: OSCSocket

init() {
    // This would be a typical setup to interact with a remote
    // Behringer X32. Randomly generate a local port, but always
    // send messages to remote port 10023.
    oscSocket = OSCSocket(
        remoteHost: "192.168.0.2",
        remotePort: 10023
    ) { [weak self] message, timeTag, host, port in
        print("Received \(message)")
    }
}
```

Similar to ``OSCServer``, an ``OSCSocket`` instance must be started before it can send or receive messages.

```swift
try oscSocket.start()
```

### Sending and Receiving OSC Messages

See <doc:Sending-OSC> and <doc:Receiving-OSC> for details on how to send and receive messages.

### Addenda on Sending using OSCSocket

The ``OSCSocket/send(_:to:port:)`` method has a slightly different behavior on ``OSCSocket`` than it does on ``OSCUDPClient``.

```swift
// The `remoteHost` and/or `remotePort` supplied at the time of
// initialization can be used by default:
let msg = OSCMessage("/test")
try oscSocket.send(msg)

// It is also possible to override the destination host and/or port
// on a per-message basis:
let msg = OSCMessage("/test")
try oscSocket.send(msg, to: "192.168.0.3", port: 8000)
```

### Notes

> OSC 1.0 Spec:
>
> With regards OSC Bundle Time Tag:
>
> An OSC server must have access to a representation of the correct current absolute time. OSC
> does not provide any mechanism for clock synchronization. If the time represented by the OSC
> Time Tag is before or equal to the current time, the OSC Server should invoke the methods
> immediately. Otherwise the OSC Time Tag represents a time in the future, and the OSC server
> must store the OSC Bundle until the specified time and then invoke the appropriate OSC
> Methods. When bundles contain other bundles, the OSC Time Tag of the enclosed bundle must be
> greater than or equal to the OSC Time Tag of the enclosing bundle.
