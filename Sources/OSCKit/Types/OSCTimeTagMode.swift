/// > Time Tag is before or equal to the current time, the OSC Server should invoke the methods
/// > immediately. Otherwise the OSC Time Tag represents a time in the future, and the OSC server
/// > must store the OSC Bundle until the specified time and then invoke the appropriate OSC
/// > Methods. When bundles contain other bundles, the OSC Time Tag of the enclosed bundle must be
/// > greater than or equal to the OSC Time Tag of the enclosing bundle.

    /// > know how far ahead in time to schedule OSC messages because it cannot learn of the network
    /// > latency statistics seen by the receiver.
    /// >
    /// > Instead of outlawing [common implementations by the OSC community] or other future
    /// > scenarios we have decided to embrace all of them by simply not specifying time tag
    /// > semantics at all in OSC 1.1. The specification simply provides a place in the stream for a
    /// > time-tag, defines units for it and we still require that the least significant bit is
    /// > reserved to mean 'immediately'."
