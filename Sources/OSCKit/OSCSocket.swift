/// Sends and receives OSC packets over the network by binding a single local UDP port to both send
/// OSC packets from and listen for incoming packets.
///
/// The `OSCSocket` object internally combines both an OSC server and client sharing the same local
/// UDP port number. What sets it apart from ``OSCServer`` and ``OSCClient`` is that it does not
/// require enabling port reuse to accomplish this. It also can conceptually make communicating
/// bidirectionally with a single remote host more intuitive.
///
/// This also fulfils a niche requirement for communicating with OSC devices such as the Behringer
/// X32 & M32 which respond back using the UDP port that they receive OSC messages from. For
/// example: if an OSC message was sent from port 8000 to the X32's port 10023, the X32 will respond
/// by sending OSC messages back to you on port 8000.
