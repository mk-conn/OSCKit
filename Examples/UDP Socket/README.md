# OSCKit UDP Socket Example

This example demonstrates OSC communication using the `OSCUDPSocket` class.

It will build for all platforms including macOS, iOS, tvOS and visionOS, and can be run in device simulators.

## Overview

The `OSCUDPSocket` class internally combines both an OSC server and client sharing the same local UDP port number. What sets it apart from `OSCUDPServer` and `OSCUDPClient` is that it does not require enabling port reuse to accomplish this. It also can conceptually make communicating bidirectionally with a single remote host more intuitive.

This also fulfils a niche requirement for communicating with OSC devices such as the Behringer X32 & M32 which respond back using the UDP port that they receive OSC messages from. For example: if an OSC message was sent from port 8000 to the X32's port 10023, the X32 will respond by sending OSC messages back to you on port 8000.

## Entitlements

If you are adding OSCKit to a macOS project that has the Sandbox entitlement, ensure that the network options are enabled. These entitlement options are already set in the example project.

## Build Note

> [!TIP]
> 
> If Xcode builds but the app does not run, it may be because Xcode is defaulting to the wrong Scheme. Ensure the example app's Scheme is selected then try again.
